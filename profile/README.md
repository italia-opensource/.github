# 🚀 Italia Open-Source

### 🧭 Mission

**Italy Open-Source** is a community founded on the open-source philosophy, where all information and content are public and open for use, modification, and integration by everyone. Our goal is to enhance the entire Italian technological landscape, giving visibility to open-source projects, communities, and everything revolving around the Italian tech sector.

### 🔍 Vision

Our vision is to create an ecosystem where sharing and collaboration are the norm. We imagine a future where every project, big or small, is accessible to everyone and can be improved by anyone. We see Italy as a reference point for open-source, a place where technology is open and accessible, and where collaboration and innovation are the order of the day.
